# Advent of Code 2023, everything in Rust
For some reason, I figured I would try and go through this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).<br/>
For some other reason, I decided to do it in Rust, a language I am definitely not super proficient in.

***This is clearly me wanting to improve at coding in Rust and have fun doing it, by no means are my solutions concise, optimised or "peak Rust development".***<br/>
Likely no *"blazingly fast"* in here, sorry.

## Disclaimer
While most of the solutions posted are what I wrote on the first try, I may come back to previous problems to try and clean up my code, especially to make it more Rust-like and less imperative-looking.
